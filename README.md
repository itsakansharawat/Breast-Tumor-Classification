# Breast-Tumor-Classification
The 'Breast Tumor Classification' repository is a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to perform binary classification of breast tumors using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, which contains features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass. The dataset includes 569 samples, each with 30 features and a binary label indicating whether the sample is malignant or benign.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build and evaluate several machine learning models for binary classification of breast tumors using scikit-learn and other Python libraries.
